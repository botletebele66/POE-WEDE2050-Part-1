## Project Overview
This project involves the design and development of a new, comprehensive(It really nit that hard) website for the **Ubuntu Rise Community Hub**, a non-profit organisation built on the foundational African philosophy of Ubuntu — "I am because we are." The website will serve as a digital extension of the physical community centre, aiming to scale its impact, streamline operations, and deepen community engagement. The centre provides critical programs for the elderly, survivors of abuse, and individuals seeking guidance and life skills.

*   **Democratize Access:** Provide discreet, 24/7 access to information and help resources for vulnerable groups.
*   **Optimise Resources:** Automate administrative tasks like volunteer applications and donation processing to free up staff time.
*   **Ensure Sustainability:** Create revenue streams through an integrated online donation system and "The Rise Shop" e-commerce platform.
*   **Build Transparency:** Showcase impact through stories and news to build trust with donors, volunteers, and the community.
*   **Digitalise Ubuntu:** Translate the spirit of mutual support into the digital realm.

 Key Features and Functionality
*   **Responsive Design: A mobile-first approach for optimal performance on all devices.
*   **Programme Information:** Detailed sections for the "Golden Years," "Safe Harbour," and "Pathfinders" programmes.
*   **Online Donation System:** A secure, integrated payment gateway (e.g., PayFast) for financial contributions.
*   **E-Commerce Platform:** "The Rise Shop" for selling products to support the centre's initiatives.
*   **Volunteer Management:** A streamlined online application process for potential volunteers.
*   **Content Management System (CMS):** WordPress backend for easy content updates by staff.
*   **Contact & Location Information:** Clear details for access and enquiries.
