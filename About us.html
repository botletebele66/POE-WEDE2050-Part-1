            <p>Ubuntu Rise Community Centre was established in partnership with the Gift of the Givers Foundation, built on the foundational African philosophy of Ubuntu â€” "I am because we are."</p>
            <p>Our journey began with a simple vision: to create a resilient, organized community where no one is left behind, and where support is a mutual process that empowers every individual to rise and thrive.</p>
